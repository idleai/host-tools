//! Provider-neutral semantic readability taxonomy for history rows.
//!
//! These enums describe what a history row *is* ([`crate::taxonomy::RecordRole`]), what kind of
//! activity it represents ([`crate::taxonomy::ActivityKind`]), how prominently it should render
//! ([`crate::taxonomy::Visibility`]), how its underlying activity concluded ([`crate::taxonomy::Outcome`]), and
//! how its chain should be presented ([`crate::taxonomy::ChainState`]), without referencing any
//! provider-specific raw format. The projection derives them deterministically
//! from raw/normalized structure; the protocol serializes them as stable
//! lowercase snake_case strings.
//!
//! Forward compatibility: classification enums carry an `Unknown` variant that
//! is both the [`Default`] and the serde catch-all (`#[serde(other)]`).
//! [`crate::taxonomy::ChainState`] instead treats missing or unrecognized values as `Active`, so
//! presentation remains unchanged across protocol versions.
